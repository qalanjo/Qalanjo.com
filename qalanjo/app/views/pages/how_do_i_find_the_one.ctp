<h1>HOW DO I FIND THE ONE </h1>
						<p>There is a valid concern for men and women alike when it comes to finding soul mates: How do I find the One?</p>
<p>Our answer starts within you. You have to find yourself first. We believe that finding out who you truly are is the best asset that you can bank on. Get to know yourself well and improve on the good side. Those are your Aces. Don't let go of them. Be a better person. But make it a point not to do those things in order to find the one. Do it mostly for yourself. Because you have to love yourself first before you will be ready to love others. You cannot give love unless you have it within you. </p>
<p>The next thing to do is have a checklist of what you want in a person. This is a list of the things you would want your soul mate to possess. Divide the list into two: the first group for the things that you cannot compromise and the second group is for the things you can compromise or even live without. Remember that there may be things that your soul mate might not be or might not have. Prepare to accept that. Nobody is perfect in the world. That is why we want you to divide your criteria into two groups. </p>
<p>Go out and meet people. We encourage you to interact. Join clubs. Join websites. There is nothing more interesting than having encounters with people. And even if these people might not turn out to be your soul mate, you wouldn't have lost anything. You would have gain friends for life and countless experiences you would love to tell your soul mate when you meet.</p>
<p>Be patient. Finding the One doesn't take overnight. No matter how we will it to. It may take days, weeks, months, even years. For all we know he might just be looking for you too. </p>
<p>Take risks. And by risks, we mean calculated risks. We do not mean you to just go on forward without thinking things over. We want you to be careful. Looking for your soul mate is like a gamble, you might win or lose. Be ready for anything. </p>
<p>Happy searching!</p>
