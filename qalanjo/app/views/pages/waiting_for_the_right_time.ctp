<h1>WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME </h1>
    						<p>Someone sang that good love is hard to come by. Waiting for your love to come is not easy. You see, people nowadays are not used to waiting. What with the instant trends that the world offers. Instant messaging, instant texts, Instant photos, instant mails, instant payouts and payments, instant noodles, instant coffee. The list is endless.  So waiting then is never an option for most people. We encourage you not to get caught up with too much "instants", because there are lots of other things in life which may not be part of these instants. </p>

<p>Love, for example, is not one of those instant things. Sure you can find people using the technology that we are enjoying now. But chances are you won't be very sure who's who unless you verify that through some processes. So love is like a waiting game. It involves processes and these processes make you wait. You have wait for the right one to come along, and avoid the ones who won't make you feel whole as a lover and a friend. The right man/woman should be able to make you feel good and make you laugh. That should be a part of what you want for a lifetime partner.
Have patience. Without it, life could be difficult. Many of us get in such a dating rut that we often settle for the person we are not compatible with. Besides a lot of good things come to those who wait. Here at Qalanjo, we don't promise no waiting. Instead we promise that the waiting is all worth it when we finally let you meet the love of your life. </p>
